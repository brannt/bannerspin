# bannerspin
A small banner system I built for an interview task

The banners are stored in a CSV file in following format:

`Image URL;prepaid shows amount;category1;category2;category3; â€¦ ;category N`

On a GET request that includes 0 to 10 categories:

http://bannerspin.com/?category[]=rock&category[]=pop

the service returns HTML with a banner that belongs to at least one category (or to any category if no categories were included in request)


Additionally develop:
- an algorithm that reduces the probability of showing the same banner twice in a row;
- an algorithm that reduces the probability that there will be no available banners for request.
